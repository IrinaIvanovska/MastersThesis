## Summary
The thesis focuses on exploring the integration of meta-learning with reinforcement
learning algorithms in the domain of building energy management, assessing the
effectiveness of combining meta-learning and RL in optimizing energy consumption,
improving the performance of building energy systems by achieving energy efficiency
objectives, and lastly, identify the challenges, limitations, and potential enhancements
associated with employing meta-learning alongside RL for building energy management
tasks.
